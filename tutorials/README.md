# Tutorials

To complete this lab, you will need to create an account at [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org) and [follow the instructions to get an API key](http://openweathermap.org/appid).

Once you have an API key, you can call the API, using the JavaScript fetch() method. **You will need to supply your own API key in every place where these tutorials use APIKEY.**

We're going to do the following in this lab:

* learn how to use the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to [fetch and display current weather conditions](/tutorials/current-weather-conditions.md)

* learn how to use the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to [fetch and display the weather forecast](/tutorials/weather-forecast.md)
